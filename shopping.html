        <p class="hero-text hero-header">Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area
          of less than 500 square miles, the
          terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical
          rainforests, and a
          mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about
          20,000. Until
          a
          recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.</p>

          <p>Taniti has a wide variety of lodging that ranges from an inexpensive hostel to one large, four-star resort.
            There are
            many small, family-owned hotels and a growing number of bed and breakfasts. All types of lodging are
            strictly regulated

          <h2>Things To Know</h2>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Power outlets are 120 volts (the same as in the United States).
          </li>
          <li>Alcohol is not allowed to be served or sold between the hours of midnight and 9:00 a.m.
          </li>
          <li>The drinking age on Taniti is 18 and the drinking age is not strictly enforced.</li>
          <li>Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English. Very little English is spoken in rural areas, especially by
            the older residents.</li>
          <li>There is one hospital and several clinics. The hospital has many multilingual employees.</li>
          <li>Violent crime is very rare on Taniti, but as tourism increases, there are more reports of pickpocketing
            and other petty
            crimes.</li>
          <li>Taniti enjoys a large number of national holidays, and many tourist attractions and restaurants will be
            closed on
            holidays, so visitors should plan accordingly.</li>
          <li>Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many businesses will also accept euros and yen. Several
            banks
            facilitate currency exchange, and many businesses accept major credit cards.</li>
